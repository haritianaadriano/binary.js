# Binary :
### Why ?

 Currently i've needed to convert a number into a binary during an IP adress exercise
 in system course. Hironnie of this history is i didn't have a calculator and connexion
 is not friend, after this i decided to create a litle programm in """javascript""" to
 convert number into binary and reverse.

 ### Usecase :

- ```
    node index.js -i <number-to-convert> -b [NOT REQUIRED] <boolean> 
  ```
